As part of the Interactive Development program, I teach various programming
courses, including advanced JavaScript development, specifically focused on AJAX
and the use of various API's. This includes the use of jQuery's AJAX methods for
consuming various public APIs, such as Twitter and Google Maps. We also focus on
good techniques for using raw JavaScript without a framework such as jQuery.
I've also taught the introductory HTML/CSS class, the intermediate course that
covers frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation.
