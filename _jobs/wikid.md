The WiKID Strong Authentication System is a patented dual-source, software-based two-factor authentication system designed to be less expensive and more extensible than hardware tokens.


I joined the company to focus on the implementation of WiKID's open source strategy. My initial focus was on developing numerous open-source and proprietary plugins for one side of the architecture using Ruby, Python, and PHP. Along the way, I started assisting with enhancements to the core Java-based architecture and CentOS-based appliance. I also architected and developed the iPhone and Android versions of the core end-user application, and assist with various marketing initiatives as needed.
