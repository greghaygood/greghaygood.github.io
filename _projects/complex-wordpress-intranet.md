title: Complex Wordpress Intranet

I got to lead a dev team tasked with building a large, complex intranet in
Wordpress. The client is a Fortune 100 company based in Atlanta, with a large
communications team that needed to disseminate a vast collection (many gigabytes
worth!) of materials to its global marketing teams. (The IT group had already
selected WP for its own internal reasons, so we had to roll with that decision.)

My team consisted of both front- and back-end developers, and as many agency
projects go, I ended up helping out everywhere. This was one of our first
responsive projects, so we relied heavily on SASS and Compass to help us with
making the layouts work everywhere. (One fun surprise during UAT was finding out
the company-issued laptops fell into our "medium" breakpoints!) 

The content and experience architecture required that the editors would be able
to upload their pieces of content, tagged as necessary according to the
taxonomies our strategy team developed. Then those would be auto-populated into
various layouts based on how the client wanted to present the material. So we
had to twist WP to support such a "non-traditional" content model, but by-golly,
we did it!
