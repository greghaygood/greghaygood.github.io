I built an example app using the [Estimote Beacon kit](https://estimote.com/)
that utilized timers paired with the "new" vs "visited" locations to introduce
small business owners to the possibilities of beacons. Since this is a new
field, with lots of hype and not yet many success stories, we wanted to
demonstrate the potential of hyper-local, targeted marketing.
