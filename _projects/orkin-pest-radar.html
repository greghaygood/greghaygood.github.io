<p> Demonstration of the Pest Radar visualization tool I built for Orkin Pest
Control, while with THINK Interactive, Inc., Orkin's digital agency. </p>

<p> I started with raw customer data from Orkin, provided in a monthly export of
their internal data. Then I used PHP to break it down by zipcode, season,
Å“month, &amp; pest category, which was then fed into a Raphael.JS visualization
to make the interactive element that showed pest activity across the country by
season. </p>
