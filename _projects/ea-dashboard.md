I led the team that developed an interactive tool to help EA's buyers convey
their design preferences to the team tasked with suggesting and building out
their dream homes. The tool uses a Myers-Briggs Personality Profile-like
approach to convert their stated preferences into EA's various design options,
thus yielding a better experience for the buyer during what can be a
high-stress, high-confusion interaction.
