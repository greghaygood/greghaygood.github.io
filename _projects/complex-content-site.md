I led a team that had to redesign a massive content site (1200+ pages) that was
already using WP as its CMS. SEO was a huge factor for this client, so we had to
figure out how to re-architect the back-end without impacting URLs or general
content layout. Of course, we also wanted to improve the content inter-linking
of this vast content repository, so our UX team came up with ways to weave
related content in, and we made it happen with the existing content, all without
having to touch all 1200+ pages.

The general approach was to add a more sophisticated WP template layer on top of
the existing content, which required the content team to only need to add a few
tags in a few areas to make some stronger links between content areas.

We were also able to integrate a separate WP blog into this new architecture so
as to improve the overall SEO potential of the client's content.
