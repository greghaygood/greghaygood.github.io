A local (to Atlanta) A/V equipment company approached me with a request to give
them an online store capability. A large part of their business is the daily
rental of equipment for various single- and multi-day events, but their existing
online process was supported only by a simple online form. Their site was
already using WP, so I suggested they could utilize WooCommerce in a slightly
altered manner in order to provide "e-commerce" without the financial
requirements and risk.

Thus, I tailored WooCommerce to disable all payment options, and modified all
the typical verbiage to indicate "Rent" vs "Buy", "Quote" vs "Order", etc (using
language translation files rather than code changes).

I also moved the client from their older shared hosting provider to WPEngine,
due to continued performance and reliability problems they had been
experiencing. So far, they've been ecstatic with the results.
